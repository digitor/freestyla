/**
  * Should be used on every widget that has it's css loaded in dynamically.
  * Then each widget should use mixin "cssload-show" to show the widget as soon as it's styles are loaded.
  * Please note that using @extend '.cssload-show' won't work because these styles would end up being added to common.css which is statically loaded in the <head>.
  * Additional styles needed (other than visibility: hidden) because child elements will still be visible if parent is not.
